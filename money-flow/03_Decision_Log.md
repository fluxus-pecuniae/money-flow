# Decision Log

Append entries only. Do not rewrite prior decisions except to add a dated correction.

## 2026-05-01T05:39:34Z - Phase 7.3 - Obsidian Becomes Strategic Brain

- `decision`: Move full strategic project memory into the Obsidian vault and keep the repo-root `money_flow_project_memory.md` only as a compatibility pointer.
- `why`: Repo operational docs should stay concise and code-state focused, while founder intent, long-horizon memory, phase context, and cross-agent coordination need a richer project brain.
- `rejected_alternatives`: Keeping full strategic memory at repo root; treating Obsidian as a replacement for `CHANGELOG.md`, `REPO_TREE.md`, `KNOWN_ISSUES.md`, or `TODO.md`.
- `follow_up_implications`: Future agents must read the Obsidian command center, current phase note, project memory, and coordination note before substantial work, then update relevant Obsidian notes after substantial work.

## 2026-05-01T05:58:03Z - Phase 7.3 - Approval-Gated Target-Choice Conversion Only

- `decision`: Add only the `target_choice_conversion` approval-consuming action hook for Phase 7.3.
- `why`: Phase 7.2/7.2.1 already proved approval-gated recommendation acceptance. The next safe automation step is converting the exact approved target choice into one child intent while keeping preview/readiness and submission explicit and separate.
- `rejected_alternatives`: Automating preview/readiness in the same phase; automating submitted-order handoff; introducing route-executor orchestration; adding ranking/scoring/fanout/target reselection.
- `follow_up_implications`: Future action hooks must continue to consume one current-lineage approval for one same-target stage and must preserve dry-run/manual policy truth plus no-downstream-artifact boundaries.
