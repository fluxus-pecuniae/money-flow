# Decision Log

Append entries only. Do not rewrite prior decisions except to add a dated correction.

## 2026-05-01T05:39:34Z - Phase 7.3 - Obsidian Becomes Strategic Brain

- `decision`: Move full strategic project memory into the Obsidian vault and keep the repo-root `money_flow_project_memory.md` only as a compatibility pointer.
- `why`: Repo operational docs should stay concise and code-state focused, while founder intent, long-horizon memory, phase context, and cross-agent coordination need a richer project brain.
- `rejected_alternatives`: Keeping full strategic memory at repo root; treating Obsidian as a replacement for `CHANGELOG.md`, `REPO_TREE.md`, `KNOWN_ISSUES.md`, or `TODO.md`.
- `follow_up_implications`: Future agents must read the Obsidian command center, current phase note, project memory, and coordination note before substantial work, then update relevant Obsidian notes after substantial work.

## 2026-05-01T05:58:03Z - Phase 7.3 - Approval-Gated Target-Choice Conversion Only

- `decision`: Add only the `target_choice_conversion` approval-consuming action hook for Phase 7.3.
- `why`: Phase 7.2/7.2.1 already proved approval-gated recommendation acceptance. The next safe automation step is converting the exact approved target choice into one child intent while keeping preview/readiness and submission explicit and separate.
- `rejected_alternatives`: Automating preview/readiness in the same phase; automating submitted-order handoff; introducing route-executor orchestration; adding ranking/scoring/fanout/target reselection.
- `follow_up_implications`: Future action hooks must continue to consume one current-lineage approval for one same-target stage and must preserve dry-run/manual policy truth plus no-downstream-artifact boundaries.

## 2026-05-01T07:28:41Z - Phase 7.4 - Approval-Gated Preview/Readiness Only

- `decision`: Add only the `prepared_order_preview_and_readiness` approval-consuming action hook for Phase 7.4.
- `why`: Phase 7.3 already proved approval-gated target-choice conversion. The next safe automation step is running existing preview/readiness inspection for the exact approved child intent while keeping submitted-order handoff explicit and separate.
- `rejected_alternatives`: Treating approval as readiness eligibility; automating submitted-order handoff; calling adapter submit; introducing route-executor orchestration; adding ranking/scoring/fanout/target reselection.
- `follow_up_implications`: Future submitted-order automation must remain a separate phase and must consume its own current-lineage approval plus existing readiness, live/routed gates, and submit-lease uncertainty guards.

## 2026-05-01T08:41:37Z - Phase 7.5 - Approval-Gated Submitted-Order Handoff Only

- `decision`: Add only the `submitted_order_handoff` approval-consuming action hook for Phase 7.5.
- `why`: Phase 7.4 already proved approval-gated preview/readiness inspection. The next bounded step is submitting the exact already-ready child intent through the existing explicit submit path while keeping readiness, live/routed gates, adapter/account authorization, and submit-lease uncertainty protections authoritative.
- `rejected_alternatives`: Treating approval as a readiness override; adding a route executor; adding broad auto-submit; retrying or failing over to another target; adding ranking/scoring/fanout/CBBO/target reselection.
- `follow_up_implications`: Future phases should harden/close out operator inspection, regression, and concurrency/uncertainty observability before considering any broader automation.

## 2026-05-01T09:40:47Z - Phase 7.5.1 - Post-Submit Approval Consumption Truth

- `decision`: Represent submitted-order-created / approval-consumption-failed truth as `consumption_pending` on the approval record.
- `why`: A persisted `SubmittedOrder` is real exchange/account truth. If approval consumption fails after that point, leaving the approval clean-active would be misleading and could obscure which approval authorized the handoff.
- `rejected_alternatives`: Rolling back `SubmittedOrder` truth after submit persistence; treating the approval as clean active; adding a retry executor; submitting again to repair approval state.
- `follow_up_implications`: Future operator tooling can inspect `consumption_pending` approvals and complete or manually reconcile approval state without creating another submitted order.
